		<br>

		<h3>This Policy</h3>

		<p>This Privacy Policy (the "Policy," "Privacy Policy") describes the information FollowUp ("FollowUp App," "FollowUp," "FollowUp Website," "Follow Up," Dayton Baird," "we," "our," or "us") collects from or about you through both this website ("Site," "The Site"), as well as the app ("App," "The App") downloadable for Android devices and iPhones. Any reference to us is applicable to both the website and our mobile App. This document also describes how we may use, share, and handle the information we collect.</p>
<br>
<p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us. You may do so by sending an E-Mail to support@followupapp.io. Please allow reasonable time for a response.</p>
<br>

<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>FollowUp follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites or use mobile Apps.

The information collected by log files include but are not limited to internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and the number of clicks. In most cases, these are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for (but is not limited to) analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.</p>
